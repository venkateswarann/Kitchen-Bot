A study of human-robot interaction using a NAO robot to assist people in the kitchen. The NAO robot was used in a user study to assist people in preparing two different recipes. We invited both potential chefs and novice learners for this experiment, and the group’s results were statistically analysed. A detailed analysis demonstrates the NAO robot’s reliability in assisting an individual cook and the extent to which this robot can be integrated into a larger process. Traditionally, learning a recipe requires the user to read through the manual’s instructions and memorise each and every step involved in the cooking process. On the other hand, this type of assistant would be straightforward to use because it would allow the user to simply ask the robot about each step without having to remember or search for a phone during the cooking process. Cooking is a daily routine for everyone, and no one wants to spend time looking for an instruction manual in the print or on their phone while they’re cooking. According to preliminary findings and detailed qualitative evidence, it appears almost like people would prefer to have such an assistant in their home. However, additional research on a complex cooking activity and environment is required to substantiate this argument.
